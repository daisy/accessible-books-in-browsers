## Demo

<!-- * [Action for Heroes (text)](https://daisy.github.io/books-in-browsers/demos/action-for-heroes/index.html) -->
<!-- * [Moby Dick (text + audio for chapters 1 and 2)](https://daisy.github.io/books-in-browsers/demos/mobydick/index.html) -->
* [Action for Heroes](https://daisy.github.io/books-in-browsers/demos/action_for_heroes_epub)

Current features: 

* Sidebar with TOC, landmarks, pages, search prototype, and publication info
* Previous/next spine item controls
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Help information
* Settings (dark mode, font size), including support for CSS @prefers-color-scheme, to automatically match the user's OS preference for dark mode.
* Bookmark any heading using the browser's built-in bookmarking
* Synchronized text + audio support (even without JS you can listen to the audio file; JS adds synchronized highlighting and phrase navigation* )
* Full text searching

Note that many of the above features are possible without any JS support. The reading experience gracefully degrades even on older devices and slower connections.
