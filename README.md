## Demo

Current features: 

* Sidebar with TOC, landmarks, pages, search prototype, and publication info
* Previous/next spine item controls
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Help information
* Settings (dark mode, font size), including support for CSS @prefers-color-scheme, to automatically match the user's OS preference for dark mode.
* Bookmark any heading using the browser's built-in bookmarking

Note that many of the above features are possible without any JS support. The reading experience gracefully degrades even on older devices and slower connections. 

Future iterations will add:

* Media overlays support
* Smoother CSS on page load
* Full text searching
* Mobile layout improvements
* Fine tune dark mode synchronization with OS prefs
* Testing across browsers
