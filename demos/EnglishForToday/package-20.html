          <span id="dtb_10914">The first one is called Gold and it allows you to use all the facilities at any time of the day or week. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10915">With this membership you can join in as many classes as you like for free. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10916">It will cost Tk.3000 for Joining and Tk.500 as annual subscription fee. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10917">Then there is the Silver one. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10918">It's the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of Tk.10 per lesson you attend. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10919">However, you can use the sports club only at certain times, between 10-00 am and 4-30 pm. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10920">So if you wish to use the swimming pool at 8-00 in the morning or 600 in the evening, you can't have access to the club. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10921">The joining fee for a Silver membership is slightly less than Tk.3000- it's Tk.2500/- but the annual fee is only Tk.200. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10922">Finally, there is the Bronze membership which probably suits people who find the Gold or Silver too expensive. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10923">Although some of the facilities are restricted with this type of membership, the fees are quite affordable. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10924">Access for the Silver member is open from 10-30 am to 3-30 pm weekdays only. </span>
          <span id="dtb_10925">The joining fee is Tk.800 and you pay a Tk. 50 annual fee. </span>
