            <span id="dtb_8918">Michael Madhusudan Dutt was a popular 19th-century Bengali poet and dramatist. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8919">He was born in Sagordari on the bank of the Kopotaksho River, a village in Keshobpur Upazila under Jessore district.</span>

          <p id="dtb_8923" xml:lang="bn-IN">
            <span id="dtb_8924">From an early age, Dutt aspired to be an Englishman in form and manner. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8925">Though he was born in a sophisticated Hindu family, he took Christianity as a young man, much to the ire of his family, and adopted the first name Michael. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8926">In his childhood, he was recognized by his teachers as a precious child with a gift of literary talent. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8927">His early exposure to English education and European literature at home and his college inspired him to imitate the English in taste, manners and intellect.</span>

          <p id="dtb_8928" xml:lang="bn-IN">
            <span id="dtb_8929">Since his adolescence he started believing that he was born on the wrong side of the planet, and that his society was unable to appreciate his intellect. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8930">He also believed that the West would be more receptive to his creative genius Michael was an ardent follower of the famous English poet Lord Byron.</span>

          <p id="dtb_8932" xml:lang="bn-IN">
            <span id="dtb_8933">So after adopting Christianity, he went to Europe and started composing poetry and drama almost entirely in English. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8934">They showed his higher level of intellectual ability. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8935">However, he failed to gain the right appreciation. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8936">To his utter frustrations he found that he was not esteemed as a native writer of English literature. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8937">Out of his frustration, he composed a sonnet in Bangla <em id="dtb_8938">"Kopotaksha Nad"</em>, which earned him huge reputation in Bangla. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8939">Gradually he could realize that his true identity lay in this Bengal and he was a sojourner in Europe. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8940">Afterwards he regretted his attraction for England and the west. </span>
            <span id="dtb_8941">He came to Bengal and devoted himself to Bangla literature from this period. </span>
