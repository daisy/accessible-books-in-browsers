We can think together about ways to fix family fights. I have one idea. When we feel angry or frustrated, we move away from each other. We find a separate room or corner to be in and we say, “Please, I need space” and everyone respects this. After about 10 minutes, the fighters check, “Are you ready to talk?”. They wait enough time until both are cool and ready to talk. The fighters then sit together and talk. Each person talks - one by one - and everyone listens. The goal is to solve the problems, so we need to stay positive and not blame or accuse each other. Each person will have to give the other some of what they want to solve the problem. If we stay calm and talk, maybe we can avoid the fight.","n":0.084},"1":{"v":"#key-message-5-solving-problems > P:nth-child(12)","n":0.577}}},{"i":12,"$":{"0":{"v":"ASK the children","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"#key-message-5-solving-problems > P:nth-child(13) > B:nth-child(1)","n":0.447}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"What other ideas do you have to fix our problems to avoid a fight?","n":0.267},"1":{"v":"#key-message-5-solving-problems > P:nth-child(14)","n":0.577}}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Children might say:","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"#key-message-5-solving-problems > P:nth-child(15) > B:nth-child(1)","n":0.447}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"“I like your idea.
