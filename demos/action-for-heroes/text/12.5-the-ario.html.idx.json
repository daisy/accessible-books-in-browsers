We welcomed days when Dads and Mums had no work or other things to do and children had no school and we could spend our days together. With COVID-19, too much of that wish came true. Now, stuck together day after day, we often wish for more to do. Yet, it seems we need to get used to being at home and surrounded by family more. Rather than wake up every morning dreading the day, it seems best to find new ways to improve being home.","n":0.101},"1":{"v":"#families-fight-covid-19-together > P:nth-child(3)","n":0.577}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"AGREE ON A DAILY ROUTINE","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"#families-fight-covid-19-together > P:nth-child(4) > B:nth-child(1)","n":0.447}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Families need routines for a set time to wake up - eat - go to sleep.
