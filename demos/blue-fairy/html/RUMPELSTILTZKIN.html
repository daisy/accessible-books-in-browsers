        <h1 id="sn-0">RUMPELSTILTZKIN</h1>
        <p><span id="sn-1">There was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful daughter. </span><span id="sn-2">
            Now it happened one day that he had
                an audience with the King, and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that he had a daughter
                who could spin straw into gold. 
        </span><span id="sn-3">
            “Now that’s a talent worth having,” said the King to the miller; “if your
                daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I’ll put her to the test.” 
        </span><span id="sn-4">
            When the girl
                was brought to him he led her into a room full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: “Now
                set to work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven’t spun the straw into gold you
                shall die.” 
        </span><span id="sn-5">Then he closed the door behind him and left her alone inside.</span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-6">So the poor miller’s daughter sat down, and didn’t know what in the world she was to do. </span><span id="sn-7">
            She hadn’t the least
                idea of how to spin straw into gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry. 
        </span><span id="sn-8">
            Suddenly the door
                opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said: “Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so
                bitterly?” 
        </span><span id="sn-9">“Oh!” answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and haven’t a notion how it’s done.” </span><span id="sn-10">
            “What
                will you give me if I spin it for you?” asked the manikin. 
        </span><span id="sn-11">“My necklace,” replied the girl. </span><span id="sn-12">
            The little man took
                the necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the
                bobbin was full. 
        </span><span id="sn-13">
            Then he put on another, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second
                too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw was spun away, and all the bobbins were
                full of gold. 
        </span><span id="sn-14">
            As soon as the sun rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and
                delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious metal. 
        </span><span id="sn-15">
            He had the miller’s daughter put
                into another room full of straw, much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin it all
                into gold before the following morning. 
        </span><span id="sn-16">
            The girl didn’t know what to do, and began to cry; then the door opened
                as before, and the tiny little man appeared and said: “What’ll you give me if I spin the straw into gold for
                you?” 
        </span><span id="sn-17">“The ring from my finger,” answered the girl. </span><span id="sn-18">
            The manikin took the ring, and whir! round went the
                spinning-wheel again, and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold. 
        </span><span id="sn-19">
            The King was
                pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold was still not satisfied, and he had the miller’s
                daughter brought into a yet bigger room full of straw, and said: “You must spin all this away in the night; but
                if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.” 
        </span><span id="sn-20">
            “She’s only a miller’s daughter, it’s true,” he thought;
                “but I couldn’t find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.” 
        </span><span id="sn-21">
            When the girl was alone the little
                man appeared for the third time, and said: “What’ll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?” 
        </span><span id="sn-22">
            “I’ve
                nothing more to give,” answered the girl. 
        </span><span id="sn-23">“Then promise me when you are Queen to give me your first child.” </span><span id="sn-24">
            “Who
                knows what may not happen before that?” thought the miller’s daughter; and besides, she saw no other way out of
                it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold.
        </span>
            <span id="sn-25">
                When the King came in the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he straightway made her his wife, and
                the miller’s daughter became a queen.
            </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-26">
            When a year had passed a beautiful son was born to her, and she thought no more of the little man, till all of a
                sudden one day he stepped into her room and said: “Now give me what you promised.” 
        </span><span id="sn-27">
            The Queen was in a great
                state, and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if he would only leave her the child. 
        </span><span id="sn-28">
            But the
                manikin said: “No, a living creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.” 
        </span><span id="sn-29">
            Then the Queen began
                to cry and sob so bitterly that the little man was sorry for her, and said: “I’ll give you three days to guess
                my name, and if you find it out in that time you may keep your child.”
        </span></p>
        <p><span id="sn-30">
            Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever heard, and sent a messenger to scour the
                land, and to pick up far and near any names he could come across. 
        </span><span id="sn-31">
            When the little man arrived on the following
                day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and all the other names she knew, in a string, but at each one
                the manikin called out: “That’s not my name.” 
        </span><span id="sn-32">
            The next day she sent to inquire the names of all the people in
                the neighborhood, and had a long list of the most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made his
                appearance. 
        </span><span id="sn-33">
            “Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks, Spindleshanks?” but he always replied: “That’s not
                my name.” 
        </span><span id="sn-34">
            On the third day the messenger returned and announced: “I have not been able to find any new names,
                but as I came upon a high hill round the corner of the wood, where the foxes and hares bid each other
                good-night, I saw a little house, and in front of the house burned a fire, and round the fire sprang the most
                grotesque little man, hopping on one leg and crying:
        </span></p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <span id="sn-35">"To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake,</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-36">And then the child away I'll take;</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-37">For little deems my royal dame</span>
            <br>
            <span id="sn-38">That Rumpelstiltzkin is my name!"</span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p><span id="sn-39">
            You can imagine the Queen’s delight at hearing the name, and when the little man stepped in shortly afterward and
                asked: “Now, my lady Queen, what’s my name?” 
        </span><span id="sn-40">
            she asked first: “Is your name Conrad?” “No.” “Is your name Harry?”
                “No.” 
        </span><span id="sn-41">“Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?” </span><span id="sn-42">
            “Some demon has told you that! some demon has told you that!”
                screamed the little man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his
                waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two.
