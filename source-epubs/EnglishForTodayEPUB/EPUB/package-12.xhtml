						<span id="dtb_5138">The pioneer of Bangladeshi modern art Zainul Abedin is widely acclaimed for his Bengal `Famine Sketches'. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5139">Through a series of sketches, Zainul not only documented the harsh famine of 1940 but also showed its sinister face through the skeletal figures of the people destined to die of starvation in a man-made plight. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5140">He depicted these extremely shocking pictures with human compassion. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5141">He made his own ink by burning charcoal and using cheap ordinary packing paper for sketching. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5142">He produced a series of brush and ink drawings, which later became iconic images of human sufferings.</span>

						<span id="dtb_5147">Zainul developed a knack for drawing and painting when he was a high school student. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5148">After completing high school, he got admission to the Government School of Art, Calcutta (now Kolkata). </span>
						<span id="dtb_5149">He graduated with the first position in first class in 1938. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5150">He was appointed teacher of the Art School while he was still a student there. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5151">He also attended the Slade School of Arts, London in 1951-52.</span>

						<span id="dtb_5153">Zainul Abedin is considered the founding father of Bangladeshi art. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5154">He was an artist of outstanding talent and earned international reputation. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5155">For his artistic and visionary qualities, he is referred to as Shilpacharya meaning `great teacher of art' in Bangladesh. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5156">He was the first Principal of the first art school in Dhaka in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). </span>
						<span id="dtb_5157">He organized the Nabanna (harvest) exhibition in 1969. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5158">In the exhibition, a 65-foot long scroll portraying the rural East Pakistan in phases from abundance to poverty. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5159">This intensified the already heightened non-cooperation movement against the Pakistan regime. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5160">The exhibition was symbolic of the artists' protest and a milestone in demanding cultural and political freedom. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5161">Zainul's dynamic style of work is evident in a 30 foot long scroll painting called <em id="dtb_5162">Manpura,</em> which was done to commemorate the death of hundreds and thousands of people in the devastating cyclone of 1970.</span>

						<span id="dtb_5168">The river Brahmaputra played a vital role in his paintings and was a source of inspiration all through his career. </span>

						<span id="dtb_5170">A series of water colours that Zainul did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor's Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. </span>

						<span id="dtb_5332">But they did not completely disappear. </span>
						<span id="dtb_5333">They evolved as a form of art, used to entertain thousands, and came to be Known as 'mime'.</span>

						<span id="dtb_6000">In order to get things done she used to give him money and food. </span>
						<span id="dtb_6001">One day after school, she gave Jobs a workbook with math problems in it. </span>
